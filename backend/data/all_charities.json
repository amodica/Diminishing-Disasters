A sponsorship program was also developed to match caring donors with individual children. Presently, almost 200 children at Hogar depend on the support of this organization. Girls and young boys live together in Hogar's main facility, sharing the chores and learning important job skills such as sewing and woodworking.

We send good books, enough books for a whole class to use. Since 1988, Books For Africa has shipped more than 41 million books to every African country. They are on once-empty library shelves, in classrooms in rural schools, and in the hands of children who have never before held a book. Each book will be read over and over again. When the books arrive, they go to those who need them most: children who are hungry to read, hungry to learn, hungry to explore the world in ways that only books make possible.",

Our model tackles inequality and unlocks the benefits that accrue from girls' education, igniting a wider social movement in girls' communities. Since 1993, CAMFED's innovative education programs in Zimbabwe, Zambia, Ghana, Tanzania and Malawi have directly supported more than 3.3 million students to attend primary and secondary school, and more than 5.7 million children have benefited from an improved learning environment. CAMA, the alumnae association for CAMFED graduates, is a powerful movement with over 138,000 members and is the largest network of its kind in Africa. CAMA is spurring remarkable change as young women from rural communities use their education to benefit others, and work to break the cycle of poverty for good. ",

The strength of the IDF, which has been guarding the State of Israel since it declared independence in 1948, derives from the selfless determination and great capabilities of the young men and women who form it. At the tender age of 18, most Israelis are drafted into the IDF. They bear the difficult tasks of defending Israel's borders and guaranteeing the safety of its people. The Israeli government is responsible for training IDF soldiers and providing them with the necessary tools for their service. FIDF is committed to providing these soldiers with love, support, and care in an effort to ease the burden they carry.",

We have helped distribute life-saving food, clothing, and medicine across the African continent, India, and Pakistan. We have also supported the construction of orphanages, churches, schools and vocational training centers, drilled water wells to provide safe drinking water, and established agricultural projects. Practical, direct grassroots action is the main focus of ICF. We channel the Christian concern of Americans into street-level impact in African villages, where logistics often frustrate traditional relief efforts. The secret ingredient is a trustworthy network of local, native missionary partners, who personally shepherd gifts of food, clothing, medicine, equipment, and funds to the places children need them most.",

We want to restore that hope with the power of play, by building playgrounds. In 2003, we became affiliated with Campus Crusade for Christ and partner directly with The JESUS Film.

We draw on the resources of the world's leading medical and academic institutions and on the lived experience of the world's poorest and sickest communities. At its root, our mission is both medical and moral. It is based on solidarity, rather than charity alone. When our patients are ill and have no access to care, our team of health professionals, scholars, and activists will do whatever it takes to make them well -- just as we would do if a member of our own families, or we ourselves, were ill.",

Of people living in poverty worldwide, up to 85% live in rural areas (OPHDI, 2014). Most struggle to grow enough food to feed their families and send their children to school.

These Villages provide living, educational, and medical facilities through Rafiki's five programs: Childcare (orphans), Education, Bible Study, Advanced Learning Institute, and Widows. Rafiki's work is both individual as well as exponential with the potential of reaching many children with Bible study and better education through its Rafiki Institute of Classical Education.

RI was started in 1979 as a citizens' movement to protect Indochinese refugees. Since then, we have expanded to become the leading advocacy organization that provokes action from global leaders to resolve refugee crises. Each year, RI conducts 20 to 25 field missions to identify displaced people's needs for basic services such as food, water, health care, housing, access to education and protection from harm. Based on our field-based knowledge of humanitarian emergencies, we successfully challenge policy makers and aid agencies to improve the lives of displaced people around the world. Where there are needs, we witness what is lacking, we present solutions and we demand action.",

The U.N. has defined restavek as a form of modern-day slavery. Every action we take - whether it is freeing children who are in restavek, engaging and educating families about the harsh realities of the practice, or spurring community leaders to effect permanent change across the country of Haiti - is done with this goal in mind. Restavek Freedom was founded in 2007 and we now have over 30 employees in two main locations in Haiti - Port-au-Prince and South Haiti - and a small support staff in the US in Cincinnati, Ohio.",

SCF began with a very simple idea: Convert what is considered \"waste\" in the Western world into much needed help in the East.<br>The idea became a reality when good quality used clothes and equipment-considered obsolete in the West but a huge leap forward in remote areas of the East-were soon being included in shipments. These supplies dramatically improved the quality of care in charitable hospitals. From its infancy, we realized the benefits of volunteerism. SCF volunteers see ourselves as catalysts, promoting low-cost, high-return programs at the grass-roots level, which have grown exponentially in last several years. We have been successful and instrumental in rebuilding lives in the rural communities of India where the government or the big nonprofits had little success. Our collaborative attitude and deep understanding of the rural issues helped overcome many challenges.",

Since 1988, Rotary and its partners in the GPEI have immunized over 3 billion children, reducing the incidence of polio by 99.9 percent and eradicating it from all but two countries. Rotary has contributed more than $2.1 billion and thousands of volunteer hours to eradication efforts. The Foundation also funds training of peacemakers through the Rotary Peace Center program. Most recently, Rotary's Disaster Response Grants are making it possible for Rotary members to respond effectively to local recovery efforts as they unfold, and COVID-19 was recently added as an eligible activity.",

V-Day believes that when art and activism come together, they have the power to transform systems and change culture. Founded by V (Eve Ensler), V-Day has inspired women all over the world and raised collective consciousness about how violence and gender intersect. V-Day is an example of the power of art as a tool for transformational holistic education and social justice. The Vagina Monologues and other works have been performed across the world by activists, survivors and artists, raising $120 million for anti-violence groups, rape crisis centers, domestic violence shelters, shattering taboos and changing the way activists make change in their communities. In Congo, V-Day launched the City of Joy, a revolutionary center for women survivors of gender violence and V-World Farm, a sustainable, educational farm that feeds City of Joy. ",

Founded by Senior Pastors Gary and Marilyn Skinner, Watoto is birthed through Watoto Church, a thriving local church in Kampala, Uganda. We exist to raise the next generation of Ugandan leaders, by pursuing excellence in academic and practical skills, integrity in conduct and moral values, so each child becomes a responsible Christian and a productive citizen of Uganda. The goal is to rescue 10,000 children in Uganda by 2023 and the vision is to replicate the Watoto model all across Africa through fostering alliances and partnerships between Christian leaders in Africa and the developed world.",
